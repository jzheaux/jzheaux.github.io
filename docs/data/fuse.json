We want our app to look like our domain.\n\nHistorically, Spring Security has one way to do this: SpEL.\nIt's done by publishing a custom `MethodSecurityExpressionHandler`, which handler returns a `SecurityExpressionRoot` instance that has the application's custom expressions.\nThis allows the application to do:\n\n```java\n@PreAuthorize(\"isSubscribed() || isAdmin()\")\n```\n\nWhile I appreciate the readability of this, I'd prefer something more like the following:\n\n```java\n@Authorize({ Subscribed.class, Admin.class })\n```\n\nThis is more testable because I can have unit tests for `Subscribed.class` and for `Admin.class`.\n\nSo, how do we achieve that?\n\nFirst, create the annotation:\n\n```java\n@PreAuthorize(\"permitAll()\")\npublic @interface Authorize {\n    Class<? extends AuthorizationManager<MethodInvocation>> any() default {};\n}\n```\n\nSecond, create an interceptor:\n\n```java\n@Component\npublic final class AuthorizeAuthorizationManager implements AuthorizationManager<MethodInvocation> {\n    private final SecurityAnnotationScanner authorize = SecurityAnnotationScanners.fromAnnotation(Authorize.class);\n    private final Map<Class<?>, AuthorizationManager<MethodInvocation>> cache = new HashMap<>();\n\n    @Override\n    public AuthorizationDecision check(Supplier<Authentication> authentication, MethodInvocation invocation) {\n        Authorize authorize = this.authorize.scan(invocation, invocation.getDeclaringClass());\n        if (authorize == null) {\n            return null;\n        }\n        return AuthorizationManagers.anyOf(Stream.of(authorize.any()).map(this::manager).toList());\n    }\n\n    private AuthorizationManager<MethodInvocation> manager(Class<?> clazz) {\n        return this.cache.computeIfAbsent(clazz, this::newInstance);\n    }\n\n    private <T> T newInstance(Class<?> clazz) {\n        try {\n            return this.cache.computeIfAbsentclazz.newInstance();\n        } catch (Exception ex) {\n            throw new RuntimeException(ex);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAnd then finally, publish an interceptor:\n\n```java\n@Bean(ROLE_INFRASTRUCTURE)\nstatic MethodInterceptor authorizeInterceptor(AuthorizeAuthorizationManager authorize) {\n    var interceptor = AuthorizationManagerBeforeMethodInterceptor.preAuthorize(authorize);\n    interceptor.setOrder(AuthorizeInterceptorOrder.PRE_AUTHORIZE - 1);\n    return interceptor;\n}\n```\n\nThis allows you to unit-test the authorization classes and get compile-time feedback on authorization expressions.","n":0.069}}},{"i":4,"$":{"0":{"v":"Tutorial","n":1},"1":{"v":"\nWelcome to Dendron! Dendron is a developer-focused knowledge base that helps you manage information using **flexible hierarchies**!\n\nYou are currently in the tutorial vault (a vault is the folder where your notes are stored). Feel free to edit this note and create new files as you go through the quickstart!\n\n## Create a Note\n\n1. Use `Ctrl+L` / `Cmd+L` to bring up the **lookup prompt**\n1. Type `dendron` and select `Create New`\n\nCongrats, you just **created your first note**! Notes in Dendron are plain text markdown with [frontmatter](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/ffec2853-c0e0-4165-a368-339db12c8e4b) on top. You can edit them in Dendron or using ~~vim~~ your favourite text editor.\n\n> NOTE: You might have noticed that the tutorial preview has not changed - this is because it is currently `locked`. This keeps the preview from changing as you edit notes. We will teach you at the end how to unlock the preview.\n\n## Find a Note\n\n1. Use `Ctrl+L` / `Cmd+L` to bring up the **lookup prompt** again\n1. Type `tutorial` and press `<ENTER>`\n   > TIP: you don't have to type out the entire query, press `<TAB>` to autocomplete\n\nYou just **found a note**. We refer to both finding and creating of notes using the **lookup prompt** as performing a **lookup**.\n\n## Organize your Notes\n\n1. Dendron has a custom [Tree View](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/hur7r6gr3kqa56s2vme986j) to view your notes. If it's not currently in focus, you can use `CTRL+SHIFT+P`/`CMD+SHIFT+P` to open the command prompt and type in [`Dendron: focus on tree view`](command:dendron.treeView.focus) to make it appear\n1. **Lookup** `tutorial.one`. Notice that the Dendron Tree View will correctly nest the `one` note under the `tutorial` note.\n\nYou just **created your first hierarchy**!\nHierarchies in Dendron are just `.` delimited files. This makes each note both a file and a folder and makes it easy to keep your notes organized\n\n## Create a link\n\n1. In `tutorial.one`, type `[[` - this should trigger the autocomplete. You can type `den` to narrow it down to `dendron` and hit enter\n\n<div style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 64.5933014354067%; height: 0;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.loom.com/embed/ef1cedcbf5394f14ae4b13afd1b6418a\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\"></iframe></div>\n\nYou just **created a link**! If you hover your mouse over the link, you can get a preview of the contents inside the note!\n\n> NOTE: the links with the `[[` are called wikilinks (because they were first popularized by Wikipedia)\n\n## Navigate a link\n\n1. Move your text cursor over the link you just created. Hold down `<CTRL>+<ENTER>`/`<CMD>+<ENTER>`\n\nYou just **navigated the link**! You can also use `CTRL+CLICK` or `CMD+CLICK` to navigate links via mouse.\n\n## Rename a Note\n\n1. Inside [[dendron]], bring up the command prompt (`CTRL+SHIFT+P`/`CMD+SHIFT+P`) and type `Dendron: Rename Note`\n1. Replace [[dendron]] with `my-note` and then press `<ENTER>`\n1. Go back to [[tutorial.one]] - you should see the updated link!\n\nYou just **renamed a note**! When you rename a note, Dendron updates all links and references of the original note.\n\nRenaming is just one of the many ways you can [refactor](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/srajljj10V2dl19nCSFiC) your knowledge base - some other common use cases include [renaming headings](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/58rjapuyn1yjjcrf9sh6fby), [merging notes](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/nxarb351z0kfbl5mkw3arw6), and [renaming entire hierarchies using regex](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/9zwkp44wnlaa8p8dpt4w8tq).\n\n## Unlock the Preview\n\nTo unlock, click the lock icon on the top right of the page or use the [Dendron: Toggle Preview Lock](command:dendron.togglePreviewLock) command. Now click on the editor again on a new page. You should see the preview change.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nCongrats, you finished the Dendron tutorial!\n\nWas there anything **unclear or buggy** about this tutorial?
